# ZombieSurvivorZ

My first "game" featuring a top-down shooter. Earn money by shooting randomly-spawned zombies and purchase new weapons at the weapon box. Uses the Java Swing framework for graphics. The map is generated by a color map, so maps could be easily procedurally generated. Zombies have rudimentary AI. Sprite sheets are used for player and zombie animations.
