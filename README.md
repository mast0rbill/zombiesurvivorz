# ZombieSurvivorZ

One of my first games: a top-down shooter. Earn money by shooting randomly-spawned zombies and purchase new weapons at the weapon box. Features color-map parsing for generating map tiles, including zombie spawner, wall, and floor. Sprite sheets are used for player and zombie animations. Uses the Java Swing library for graphics.
